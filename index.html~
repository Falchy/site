<p>This is a build log of the ergodash i recently built. This is also my first go at making something with html, so please be kind ;) I will talk about a few things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mistakes i made</li>
	<li>What i learned</li>
	<li>First thoughts on the build</li>
	<li>Thoughts after using it a bit (wip)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mistakes i made</h2>
<p>I have made both a hand wired keyboard, and a dz60 based kit before, so i am not completely new to building keebs. This was my first go at something like this though, so of course i made some mistakes. <br>
The biggest mistake i made was probably underestimating the possibilities i had to mess things up. I was a bit to eager, and did things a little too fast. Here you can see my first mistake. I scimmed the instructions, <br>
read that the diodes should be soldered to the round and square pads, and went to town. </p>
